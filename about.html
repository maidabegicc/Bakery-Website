        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Sweet Delights Bakery, a place where every treat is made
          with love, passion, and the finest ingredients. Our story began with a
          dream to create a space where the community could come together to
          enjoy baked goods that not only taste amazing but also feel like a
          warm hug on a cold day. Over the years, we’ve grown from a small local
          bakery to a beloved destination for pastry enthusiasts far and wide.
        </p>

          At the heart of Sweet Delights Bakery is a commitment to tradition and
          quality. Every cupcake, croissant, and cake we bake tells a story – a
          story of carefully sourced ingredients, time-tested recipes, and a
          dedication to bringing a smile to your face. Whether it’s the buttery
          layers of our croissants or the whimsical designs of our custom cakes,
          we believe every detail matters.
